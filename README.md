I’m Jan, and this is my Repository
<!--- - Until recently, I was a Master Student of Applied Computer Science at Otto Friedrich University Bamberg. Before that, I worked as a Game Designer. ---> 
I'm a Software Developer based in Germany. 
My work experience is in Python (backend) and Javascript (specifically react, vue, typescript), mostly for small German startups. 
Earlier, I graduated with a Master in Computer Science from University Bamberg.  
You can find a short overview in this repository.
- My interests are games (I used to work as a Game Designer before my Studies), random facts, and cooking. 
- Professionally, I quite like concepts of classic/general AI, and am interested in learning more about Quantum Computing.
- I am open for a new Job. At this phase in my career, gathering new experiences is paramount, but long term, I'd be particularly interested in System Architechture and, again, Quantum Computing - I'm probably not quite there yet.

- Video Project from my Master Studies: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsNYShTHSU4 (German, created with Blender and a Team of 3)
- Professional Output: I worked on online Applications for digital Tachograph cards as an external developer. The result of my participation can, for Example, be seen here: https://www.tuvsud.com/de-de/branchen/mobilitaet-und-automotive/fahrtenschreiberkarten/fahrerkarte#/
